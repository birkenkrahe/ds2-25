* R Basics Review: 10 Problems

This review covers essential R topics, including arithmetic, vectors,
matrices, data frames, factors, and lists. Solve each problem by
writing R code and explain your answers briefly.

** Problem 1: Arithmetic Operations

Write R expressions to perform the following calculations:

1. Add 15 and 27.
2. Divide 144 by 12.
3. Calculate 8 squared.
4. Find the remainder when 25 is divided by 4.

** Problem 2: Vector Operations

Create a numeric vector named *scores* with the values 85, 90, 78, 92,
and 88. Perform the following operations:

1. Calculate the mean of the *scores* vector.
2. Add 5 to each element of the vector.
3. Select the third element from the vector.
4. Check if any element in the vector is greater than 95.

** Problem 3: Matrix Operations

Create a 3x3 matrix named *m* using the numbers 1 to 9, filled by
row. Perform the following operations:

1. Extract the element in the second row, third column.
2. Calculate the sum of each row.
3. Transpose the matrix.

** Problem 4: Creating Data Frames

Create a data frame named *students* with the following data:

| Name     | Age | Score |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Alice    | 20  | 85    |
| Bob      | 22  | 90    |
| Charlie  | 19  | 78    |

Perform the following operations:

1. Select the *Score* column.
2. Add a new column named *Pass* that is TRUE if the score is 80 or above, and FALSE otherwise.

** Problem 5: Factor Levels
Create a factor named *grades* with the values "A", "B", "A", "C", and "B". Perform the following operations:

1. Display the levels of the factor.
2. Change the levels to "Excellent", "Good", and "Average" corresponding to "A", "B", and "C", respectively.
3. Count how many students received each grade.

** Problem 6: Lists
Create a list named *student1* that contains the following elements:

1. Name: "Alice"
2. Age: 20
3. Scores: A numeric vector with values 85, 88, 90

Perform the following operations:

1. Access the *Name* element of the list.
2. Add a new element to the list named *Graduated* with the value FALSE.

** Problem 7: Subsetting Vectors
Given the vector *temperatures* = c(72, 75, 78, 80, 77, 73, 68), perform the following operations:

1. Extract the first three values.
2. Find the temperatures greater than 75.
3. Replace the last value with 70.

** Problem 8: Matrix Calculations
Create a 2x3 matrix named *sales* with the following data:

| Q1 | Q2 | Q3 |
|----|----|----|
| 150 | 200 | 250 |
| 180 | 220 | 270 |

Perform the following operations:

1. Calculate the total sales for each quarter.
2. Find the maximum value in the matrix.

** Problem 9: Data Frame Manipulation
Using the *students* data frame from Problem 4, perform the following operations:

1. Filter the data frame to show only students who passed.
2. Sort the data frame by the *Score* column in descending order.

** Problem 10: Working with Factors and Lists Together
Create a list named *classroom* that contains:

1. A factor named *Subjects* with levels "Math", "Science", and "History".
2. A numeric vector named *Attendance* with values 25, 28, and 23.
3. A character vector named *Teachers* with values "Mr. Smith", "Ms. Lee", "Mrs. Johnson".

Perform the following operations:

1. Access the *Subjects* element of the list.
2. Add a new element named *Location* with the value "Room 101".
