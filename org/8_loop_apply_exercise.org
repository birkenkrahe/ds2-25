* Titanic Survival Analysis with ~tapply~
** Objective

   Use R’s ~tapply~ function to analyze the Titanic dataset and determine
   passenger survival by sex. Write your own code and document your
   process in this Org-mode file.

** Dataset
   The built-in ~Titanic~ dataset (convertible to a data frame) includes:
   - ~Class~: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, Crew)
   - ~Sex~: Male, Female
   - ~Age~: Child, Adult
   - ~Survived~: No, Yes
   - ~Freq~: Number of passengers

** Submission
   Submit this Emacs Org-mode file with code, documentation and sample
   results.

** Tasks
   For each task, include:
   1. A description of your approach.
   2. Your R code in a source block.
   3. The output and a brief interpretation.

*** Task 1: Setup

    Convert the ~Titanic~ dataset to a data frame and explore its structure.

    How many variables are in the dataset, and what does ~Freq~ represent?

    #+begin_src R
      ## Your code here (e.g., convert Titanic and check structure)

    #+end_src

*** Task 2: Total Passengers by Sex
    Calculate the total number of male and female passengers.

    How many male and female passengers were on the Titanic, and what’s
    the total?

    #+begin_src R
      ## Your code here (e.g., sum Freq by Sex)

    #+end_src

*** Task 3: Survivors vs. Non-Survivors
    Determine the total number of survivors and non-survivors.

    How many passengers survived vs. died, and what does this suggest about the disaster?

    #+begin_src R
      ## Your code here (e.g., sum Freq by Survived)

    #+end_src

*** Task 4: Male and Female Survivors and Non-Survivors
    Compute the number of male and female survivors and non-survivors.

    What are the counts for each combination (e.g., male survivors), and what pattern emerges?

    #+begin_src R
      ## Your code here (e.g., sum Freq by Sex and Survived)

    #+end_src


*** Task 5: Bonus (Optional)
    Analyze survival by ~Sex~, ~Survived~, and ~Age~.

    What’s one interesting insight about survival differences (e.g.,
    between adult males and female children)?

    #+begin_src R
      ## Your code here (e.g., sum Freq by Sex, Survived, and Age)

    #+end_src

** Submission Guidelines

   - Use this Org-mode file.
   - For each task:
     - Explain your thought process in text (e.g., "I used tapply() to
       sum Freq by Sex because...").
     - Interpret the output below the results (e.g., "This shows more
       females survived because...").
   - Write your own code—don’t copy solutions. Experiment and explain
     your choices.

** Grading Criteria
   - *Correctness*: Code answers the questions accurately.
   - *Documentation*: Explanations are clear and justify choices.
   - *Completion*: All required tasks attempted; bonus is optional for
     extra credit.
