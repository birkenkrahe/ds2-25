#+BEGIN_example
+--------+   +--------+   +---------+   +--------+   +-----------+
| Obtain |-->| Scrub  |-->| Explore |-->| Model  |-->| Interpret |
+--------+   +--------+   +---------+   +--------+   +-----------+
#+END_example

1) *Obtain data:* 10% of the work
   - Download data over the network (e.g. HTTPS)
   - Query data form a database API (e.g. MySQL)
   - Extract data from another file (e.g. CSV)
   - Generate data yourself (e.g. measure or synthesize)

2) *Scrub data*: 80% of the work
   - Filtering lines (e.g. by label "spam" or "ham")
   - Extracting columns (e.g. "name", "sales")
   - Replacing values (e.g. ~chr~ to ~factor~)
   - Extracting words (e.g. removing stopwords)
   - Handling missing values and duplicates (e.g. ~na.rm~, imputation)
   - Converting data to another format (e.g. CSV to TSV).

3) *Explore data*:
   - Look at your data (e.g. ~str~)
   - Derive statistics from your data (e.g. ~summary~)
   - Create visualizations (e.g. ~plot~, ~barplot~, ~boxplot~)
   - Transform data (e.g. ~log10~, ~data.frame~)

4) *Modeling data:*
   - Clustering (e.g. ~kmeans~)
   - Classification (e.g. ~class::knn~)
   - Regression (e.g. ~lm~)
   - Neural nets (e.g. ~nnet~)
   - Principal Components Analysis (e.g. ~prcomp~)

5) *Interpret data:*
   - Causal inference (did one thing really cause another?)
   - Machine learning (can you predict future patterns?)
   - Communication (what does this mean to you?)

* What is the command line?

- Answers:
  #+begin_quote
  1. A text-based interface to interact with your computer (CLI).
  2. A tool where you type commands instead of clicking (GUI).
  3. A window to control your operating system using text.
  4. The original OS interface for systems like Unix.
  5. A developer's power tool for automation and system tasks.
  6. A fast, precise way to manage files and run programs.
  7. An interface to a shell program like ~bash~.
  8. A programming environment that is always available everywhere.
  9. Thousands of super-fast tiny tools (~compgen -c | sort -u | wc -l~)
  10. Pure nerd fun. Examples: ~yes~, ~sl~, ~cowsay~
  #+end_quote

- Examples (only on a fully functioning shell: ~M-x term bash~)

  [[../img/train.png]]

  1. ~fortune~ [luck that never runs out]

  2. ~yes "I am learning linux"~ [yes, you can]

  3. ~echo "The commandline is OSEMN!" | cowsay -f tux"~ [

  4. ~sl~ [if you mistype 'ls']

  5. ~whoami~ [find out who you really are]

* Why is the command-line awesome for data science?

The command-line is *agile*, *augmenting*, *scalable*, *extensible*, and
*ubiquitous*.

** The command line is agile

- It provides a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) -> play

- It is very close to the filesystem -> fast

** The command line is augmenting

- Integrates well with other technologies -> interoperable

- You can glue tools to other tools -> pipelining

- You can run commands from the session -> link to ~system~

- You can convert code into a reusable script -> portable

** The command line is scalable

- CLI scripts can be automated and debugged easily -> re-run

- Platform independence -> repeatable

- Scripts can be timed with ~cron~ -> batch mode

- Scripts can be run remotely -> networked

- Scripts can be run in parallel on data chunks -> parallelized

** The command line is extensible

- Though > 50 years old, the CLI actively being developed -> fresh

- The CLI is language agnostic (though inclined towards C) -> open

- The CLI is a FOSS product developed by volunteers -> free

- You can easily create your own new tools -> extensible

** The command line is ubiquitous

- It comes with every Unix-like operating system -> everywhere

- It runs on 100% of the world's supercomputers -> HPC

- It runs on servers, laptops, embedded systems -> embedded

* Essential Unix concepts

- If you don't have Linux/Unix (macOS) but admin rights, you can get a
  *docker* container image (after downloading and installing
  ~docker~). Details in the free textbook:
  [[https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/][datascienceatthecommandline.com/]]

- An alternative on Windoze is the ~Cygwin~ toolbox: [[https://cygwin.com/][cygwin.com/]] - a
  large collection of CLI tools (the next best thing to native Linux).

- The environment is defined by four layers:
  #+BEGIN_example
  +----------------------+
  |  Command-line tools  |  <-- e.g., ls, grep, curl, wget
  +----------------------+
            ↑
  +----------------------+
  |      Terminal        |  <-- e.g., terminal, xterm, eshell
  +----------------------+
            ↑
  +----------------------+
  |        Shell         |  <-- e.g., bash, zsh, fish
  +----------------------+
            ↑
  +----------------------+
  |   Operating System   |  <-- e.g., Linux, macOS, Windoze
  +----------------------+
  #+END_example

* Layer 4 (application): Command-line tools

- Code along:
  #+begin_quote
  Open a full terminal in Emacs now (=M-x term bash=) to code
  along. This terminal can only be accessed with your mouse.

  1. ~*terminal*~ runs an actual shell *inside* Emacs.
  2. ~char mode~ is activated with ~C-c C-k~ (raw terminal)
  3. ~line mode~ is activated with ~C-c C-j~ (Emacs-like editing)

  Try it now. You can always ~C-x o~ into ~*terminal*~ but you can only
  jump out of it with ~C-x o~ when you're in ~line mode~ (~C-c C-j~).

  In ~char mode~ you can also not use the minibuffer.
  #+end_quote

- Examples of command-line tools: ~ls~, ~cat~, ~cd~, ~jq~
  
  1. ~ls~ for listing files (user-defined)

  2. ~cat~ for viewing content (user-defined)

  3. ~cd~ for changing directory (built-in)

  4. ~type~ to find out the kind of tool this is

  5. ~which~ to find out what tool you're using

  6. ~echo~ to direct output straight to ~stdout~

  7. ~jq~ to process JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) content

     #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
       echo '{
         "name": "Leonardo",
         "role": "Inventor",
         "age": 67
             }'       > data.json
       cat data.json
       jq '.name' data.json
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : {
     :   "name": "Leonardo",
     :   "role": "Inventor",
     :   "age": 67
     :       }
     : "Leonardo"

* Layer 3 (presentation): Terminal

- Terminal: An application that runs on top of the shell. It can be
  emulated in different ways (the GUI does that, too). In Emacs
  e.g. as a ~bash~ code block:

  #+begin_src bash :results output
    seq 3
  #+end_src

- Just like in R: When encountering a new function, check the ~man~
  page. Directly in Emacs: ~M-x man seq~.

- Use ~seq~ to create the sequence [0...1] in steps of 0.1. In R:
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    seq(from=0,to=1,by=0.1)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :  [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0

- Solution in the terminal:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    seq 0 0.1 1
  #+end_src

* Layer 2 (session): Shell

- The shell is an interpreter for command-line commands.

- There are many shells starting with ~sh~, then ~bash~ (Bourne-Again
  SHell), ~csh~ (C-language feel), ~zsh~ (now on MacOS see [[https://ohmyz.sh/][ohmyz.sh]]), ~fish~
  (friendly interactive shell), etc.

- An overview:
     
  | Shell | Base   | Scripting | Interactive Features | Customizability |
  |-------+--------+-----------+----------------------+-----------------|
  | ~sh~    | Oldest | Minimal   | Minimal              | Low             |
  | ~bash~  | Common | Excellent | Good                 | Good            |
  | ~csh~   | Old    | Fragile   | Decent               | Medium          |
  | ~zsh~   | Modern | Excellent | Excellent            | Very High       |

- You can write a shell yourself in C (it's a common project at MIT,
  UC Berkeley, Stanford U), check out e.g. the tutorial @ [[https://brennan.io][brennan.io]],
  or [[https://craftinginterpreters.com][craftinginterpreters.com]] by Nystrom.

  [[../img/craftinginterpreters.png]]

* Layer 1 (process): Operating System (OS)

- For GNU/Linux, "Linux" is the name of the kernel or heart of the OS.

- OS operate in two modes, "user" (or application) mode, and "kernel"
  (or system) mode. Whenever it gets serious (and fast), kernel mode
  is triggered by an interrupt signal. When things get slow and human
  again, control is given back to the user.

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  +------------------+
  |   User Mode      |  <-- Applications (e.g., bash, Firefox, gcc)
  +------------------+
            |
            | System calls (e.g., read, write, fork)
            v
  +------------------+
  |  Kernel Mode     |  <-- OS core functions (memory mgmt, I/O,
  +------------------+                         process scheduling)
  #+END_SRC

- GNU stands for "GNU's not UNIX".  

- Example: Whenever you open a web page, the kernel builds a ~socket~ so
  that your PC can send and receive data over the network.

- Example: ~stdout~ (e.g. displaying this on the screen) is an
  abstraction (a ~FILE~ with descriptor 1) managed by the kernel.

  Writing a string to ~stdout~ (C program):
  #+begin_src C :tangle fputs_example.c :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
    fputs("Hello from fputs on the command-line!\n", stdout);
  #+end_src

  Building the program:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    touch fputs_example.c
    make fputs_example
  #+end_src

  Running the program on the shell
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    ./fputs_example
  #+end_src

* Using command-line tools / file system

- Using these tools competently relies on your understanding of the
  file system, especially the file *path*, and tool *options*.

- Absolute paths:
  #+begin_quote
  A full path that starts from the root ~/~ directory, and that always
  points to the same location no matter where you are.
  #+end_quote

- Example: Your present working directory
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    pwd
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : /home/aletheia/GitHub/admin/spring25/dsc205/org
  
- Relative paths:
  #+begin_quote
  A path relative to your current working directory (~pwd~), and that
  depends on where you are in the file system.
  #+end_quote

- Example: List all CSV files in ~../data/~
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo $(pwd)
    ls ../data/*.csv
  #+end_src

- For the next example, put text a file ~movies.txt~, and then view the
  file with ~cat~:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo Matrix > movies.txt # redirect text to file (creating it)
    echo Star Wars >> movies.txt  # append text to end of file
    echo Home Alone >> movies.txt
    echo Indiana Jones >> movies.txt
    echo Back to the Future >> movies.txt            
    cat movies.txt # view file
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Matrix
  : Star Wars
  : Home Alone
  : Indiana Jones
  : Back to the Future

- Options or command-line arguments:
  #+begin_quote
  The CLI tools are functions, and options are their
  arguments. E.g. ~head~ (open the ~man~ page):

      head [OPTION] ... [FILE] ...

  The ellipses mean that you can provide multiple arguments.        
  #+end_quote

- Use ~head~ on =movies.txt=, printing the first three lines only:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    head -n 3 movies.txt
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Matrix
  : Star Wars
  : Home Alone

* Types of command-line tools
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/11_cmdline.png]]

- A command-line tool is any program that can be run on the CLI.

- There are five types of tools: Binary executables, shell built-ins,
  interpreted scripts, shell functions, and aliases.

- *Binary executables:*
  #+begin_quote
  Machine code. Example: ~make~ a hello world C program. The binary
  executable is the ~make~ target ~./hello~ at the very end.
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo '#include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
       printf("\nHello,world!");
       return 0;
    }' > hello.c # create it

    cat hello.c # view it

    make hello # build it

    ./hello # run it
  #+end_src

- *Shell built-in functions*:
  #+begin_quote
  Command-line tools provided by the shell, like ~cd~ or ~pwd~. You can
  check with ~type~.
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    type cd
    type pwd
    type ls
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : cd is a shell builtin
  : pwd is a shell builtin
  : ls is /usr/bin/ls

- *Interpreted scripts*:
  #+begin_quote
  A text file that is executed by a binary executable - e.g. R, Python
  and ~bash~ scripts. Example: ~bash~ script.
  #+end_quote

- *Example 1:* A script that checks if a file exists and copies it.
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both :tangle movies.sh
    #!/usr/bin/bash
    if [ -f "movies.txt" ]; then
        cp -v movies.txt Movies.txt
    else
        echo 'No "movies.txt" file to be found!'
    fi
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 'movies.txt' -> 'Movies.txt'

- Could also have been a ~.sh~ program: tangle it, then run the
  following commands to
  1) view the file
  2) check file permissions
  3) change file permissions
  4) run the file.
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    cat movies.sh # view file
    ls -l movies.sh # long file listing
    chmod +x movies.sh # change file permissions
    ls -l movies.sh
    ./movies.sh 2>&1 # redirect stderr to stdout
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : #!/usr/bin/bash
  : if [ -f "movies.txt" ]; then
  :     cp -v movies.txt Movies.txt
  : else
  :     echo 'No "movies.txt" file to be found!'
  : fi
  : -rwxrwxr-x 1 aletheia aletheia 130 Apr 15 09:27 movies.sh
  : -rwxrwxr-x 1 aletheia aletheia 130 Apr 15 09:27 movies.sh
  : 'movies.txt' -> 'Movies.txt'

- The `shebang` =#!/usr/bin/bash= tells the kernel which program should
  execute the script.

- *Example 2:* A Python script that computes a factorial (n!)
  #+begin_src python :tangle fac.py :results none :exports both :session *Python* :python python3 
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    def factorial(x):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2,x+1):
            result *= i
        return result

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        x = int(sys.argv[1])
        sys.stdout.write(f"{factorial(x)}\n")
  #+end_src

- Tangle it, and then run it on the command-line:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    ls -l fac.py
    python3 fac.py 5
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 aletheia aletheia 230 Apr 15 09:37 fac.py
  : 120

- Here, the shebang =#!/usr/bin/env python= runs the ~python~ program in a
  modified environment. This is preferred to =#!/usr/bin/python= because
  the location of the ~python~ program changes. ~env~ is more portable:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    which python
    which python3
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : /usr/bin/python3

- *Shell functions*:
  #+begin_quote
  A function that is executed by the shell itself,
  e.g. ~bash(1)~. Usually small, more personal.
  #+end_quote

- Example 1: Shell function that does the same as =fac.py=
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    fac() { seq $1 | paste -s -d\* - | bc;}
    fac 5
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 120

- Let's take it apart:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    seq 5
    seq 5 | paste -s -d\* -
    seq 5 | paste -s -d\* - | bc    
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1
  : 2
  : 3
  : 4
  : 5
  : 1*2*3*4*5
  : 120
  
- Example 2: Converting a binary or a hexadecimal to a decimal.
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo "ibase=2; 10001110011" | bc
    echo "ibase=16; 40DF" | bc   # 15*16^0+13*16^1+4*16^3
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1139
  : 16607

- As a shell function:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    bin2dec() { echo "ibase=2; $1" | bc; }
    bin2dec 10001110011
    hex2dec() { echo "ibase=16; $1" | bc; }
    hex2dec 40DF
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1139
  : 16607

- *Aliases:*
  #+begin_quote
  Aliases are like macros - commands that you find yourself executing
  all the time, or when you keep misspelling a certain command. They
  don't allow parameters unlike shell functions.
  #+end_quote

- Examples: Run these in a terminal
  #+begin_example sh
    alias lt='ls -lt'
    lt mov*
    alias l='ls --color -lhF --group-directories-first'
  #+end_example

- To see all existing aliases defined in ~~/.bashrc~, enter ~alias~.

- Establish the ~type~ of the different functions and aliases created by
  you: =fac=, =bin2dec=, =lt=, as well as ~pwd~, ~cd~.
  #+begin_example
  $ type -a fac bin2dec lt pwd cd
  fac is a function
  fac () 
  { 
      seq $1 | paste -s -d\* - | bc
  }
  bin2dec is a function
  bin2dec () 
  { 
      echo "ibase=2; $1" | bc
  }
  lt is aliased to `ls -lt'
  pwd is a shell builtin
  pwd is /usr/bin/pwd
  pwd is /bin/pwd
  cd is a shell builtin
  #+end_example

* Combining command-line tools

- Command-line tools are Unix tools: Designed to do one thing only and
  do it well, i.e. fast and securely.

- Combining these simple tools turns them into a powerful toolchain:
  This is possible by managing the data streams (file descriptors).

- File descriptors is how Unix manages processes. The data streams for
  communication are:
  1. *standard output* (~stdout~) - file descriptor 0

  2. *standard input* (~stdin~) - file descriptor 1

  3. *standard error* (~sterr~) - file descriptor 2

- Both ~stdout~ and ~stderr~ are by default redirected to the terminal so
  that normal output and error messages are printed on the screen:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px :float nil:
  #+caption: Source: Janssens, 2021 (p. 52)
  [[../img/stream.png]]

- If you run ~rev~, nothing happens because ~rev~ expects input from the
  keyboard. To stop sending input, press CTRL-D.
  #+begin_example
   $ rev
   Birkenkrahe
   eharknekriB
   Madam
   madaM
   Noon
   nooN
  #+end_example

- With ~curl~, you can download a file and pipe it to ~grep~:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px :float nil:
  #+caption: Source: Janssens, 2021 (p. 52)
  [[../img/stream2.png]]

- Let's look at ~curl~ as an example for a program that scrapes data of
  the web using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators = web IP addresses).

* If you don't have ~curl~ - local install (or use Google Cloud Shell)

1. Download the source
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     cd ~/Downloads
     wget https://curl.se/download/curl-8.7.1.tar.gz
   #+end_src

2. Extract the archive
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     cd ~/Downloads
     tar -xzf curl-8.7.1.tar.gz
     cd curl-8.7.1
     pwd
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : /home/aletheia/Downloads/curl-8.7.1

3. Configure the build with a local prefix
   #+begin_example bash
     cd ~/Downloads/curl-8.7.1
     ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local --without-ssl
     make -j4
     make install
   #+end_example

4. Check that your =$PATH= contains ~~/.local/bin~ (otherwise add
   =$HOME/.local/bin= to the =PATH= and =source ~/.bashrc=)
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     echo $PATH
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : /home/aletheia/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

5. Verify the local ~curl~
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     which -a curl
     curl --version  # brand new local version - built here
     /usr/bin/curl --version # older binary version - pre-installed
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_example
   /home/aletheia/.local/bin/curl
   /usr/bin/curl
   /bin/curl

* Pipelining with ~curl~, ~grep~, ~tee~, and ~wc~

- Example: Getting Alice in Wonderland from Project Gutenberg:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    curl -s "https://gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt"|grep "CHAPTER"

  #+end_example

- If you did not succeed in getting ~curl~ installed, you can also use ~wget~:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    wget -O alice.txt https://gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
    cat alice.txt | grep CHAPTER
  #+end_src

- To avoid the duplicate output, you've got to work a lot harder and
  use so-called *regular expressions*.
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    curl -s "https://gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt" | grep "CHAPTER" |
    grep -vE '^CHAPTER [IVXLC]+\.?\s*$' | tee ch.txt
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
   CHAPTER I.     Down the Rabbit-Hole
   CHAPTER II.    The Pool of Tears
   CHAPTER III.   A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
   CHAPTER IV.    The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
   CHAPTER V.     Advice from a Caterpillar
   CHAPTER VI.    Pig and Pepper
   CHAPTER VII.   A Mad Tea-Party
   CHAPTER VIII.  The Queen’s Croquet-Ground
   CHAPTER IX.    The Mock Turtle’s Story
   CHAPTER X.     The Lobster Quadrille
   CHAPTER XI.    Who Stole the Tarts?
   CHAPTER XII.   Alice’s Evidence
  #+end_example

- Do yourself a favor and learn to use regular expressions this
  summer! The best way to do this is by picking up ~perl~ (see ~man~), an
  ancient, very powerful text manipulation language, or ~sed~, the data
  stream editor. More at: [[https://learn.perl.org/][learn.perl.org/]] and
  [[https://linuxhandbook.com/sed-command-basics/][linuxhandbook.com/sed-command-basics/]]

- You can extend the pipe to find out how many chapters there are:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    cat ch.txt | wc -l
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 12

- Here, I used first ~tee~ in the previous statement to "tee off" the
  output of ~grep~ to a file =ch.txt=, and then ran ~wc~ (word count) on the
  file, counting the number of lines with the ~-l~ flag.

- If you don't specify a flag, ~wc~ will return lines, then words, and
  characters:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo '  lines   words   chars' &&  # header
        cat ch.txt | wc                # word count
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :   lines   words   chars
  :      12      70     481

* Redirecting Input and Output

- Besides piping output from one tool to another tool, you can save it
  to a file by redirecting the output.
  #+attr_html: :width 600px :float nil:
  [[../img/stream3.png]]

  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    /usr/bin/curl "https://gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt" | grep "CHAPTER" > chapter
    head -n 3 chapter
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :  CHAPTER I.     Down the Rabbit-Hole
  :  CHAPTER II.    The Pool of Tears
  :  CHAPTER III.   A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

- Here, you will get the error message "=curl: (1) Protocol "https" not
  supported=", if you used the =--without-ssl= option when building
  it. Change to =http= instead.

- To append the output to a file (after the original contents if any),
  use =>>=
  #+begin_src bash :results silent :exports both
    echo -n "Hello," > greeting.txt # -n: do not output trailing newline
    echo  " World!" >> greeting.txt
  #+end_src

- Can you view the file and count the number of words in two lines of
  code?
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    cat greeting.txt
    cat greeting.txt | wc -w
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, World!
  : 2

- The same result can be achieved by passing the file to ~stdout~ without
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    < greeting.txt wc -w
  #+end_src  

  #+RESULTS:
  : 2
