** TODO A brief review of R - 10 problems
#+attr_html: :width 400px: 
[[../img/review.png]]

- *Download* the practice file: [[https://tinyurl.com/R-basics-org][tinyurl.com/R-basics-org]] on the
  command-line using =wget= or in Emacs using =eww=

- *Complete* the practice file: There are three short problems for each
  of R's data structures - numbers, vectors, matrices, data frames,
  factors, and lists.

- *Upload* your completed practice file to Canvas so that I can check
  your state of mind and mastery.

- *Review* the solutions in class.

- *Review* your own solutions depending on how you did in class.

** TODO On DataCamp assignments

1. Watch the video first with full attention.
2. Write down immediate questions for later.
3. Build a notebook for DataCamp courses.
4. Recreate the individual steps in the video.
5. Create or import datasets.
6. Look up function definitions.
7. Solve the exercises outside of DataCamp.
8. If you loathe Emacs, use DataLab or Colab instead.
9. Don't ignore nagging questions that you have.
10. Start a journal to summarize what you've learnt.
