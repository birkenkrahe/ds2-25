- [X] On the DataCamp assignments
- [X] A brief review of R (followed by test 1 - until Thu 23-Jan)
- [ ] Calling functions: Scope and R environments

** DONE On DataCamp assignments

1. Watch the video first with full attention.
2. Write down immediate questions for later.
3. Build a notebook for DataCamp courses.
4. Recreate the individual steps in the video.
5. Create or import datasets.
6. Look up function definitions.
7. Solve the exercises outside of DataCamp.
8. If you loathe Emacs, use DataLab or Colab instead.
9. Don't ignore nagging questions that you have.
10. Start a journal to summarize what you've learnt.

** DONE Review

1. When are data Big Data?
   #+begin_quote
   3V: When they're either very large (volume > 1 PetaByte), coming in
   fast (velocity), or consist of multiple modes or media types
   (variety).
   #+end_quote

2. What does "DevOps" mean?
   #+begin_quote
   "Development Operations", frameworks that address the interface
   between IT operations and software developers.
   #+end_quote

3. What exactly does =sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y= mean?
   #+begin_quote
   "As super-user, use the package manager program =apt= to =update= the
   list of installed software (don't ask me any questions, and then
   (provided the =update= process is complete), install the available
   =upgrade= software (again without asking me any questions).
   #+end_quote

4. Name at least one element of a "data science workflow"!
   #+begin_quote
   1) *Search* for data, e.g. with a search engine
   2) *Download* data, e.g. with =wget= on the command-line
   3) *Edit* code & documentation in a notebook, e.g. =.org= in Emacs
   4) *Run* scripts on the command-line using the =bash= shell program
   5) *Debug* scripts, e.g. using the GNU debugger =gdb=
   6) *Visualize* results, e.g. using R's =plot= function
   7) *Predict* trends, e.g. using R's =lm= regression model
   8) *Transform* data, e.g. using =log10= for base-10 logarithms
   9) *Delete* data, e.g. by redirecting errors to =/dev/null=
   10) *Model* data, e.g. by converting CSV data to a =data.frame=
   #+end_quote

5. What is *RStudio*?
   #+begin_quote
   RStudio is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R
   (and Python, with SQL) with notebook and publication capabilities.
   #+end_quote

6. What is the "Tidyverse"?
   #+begin_quote
   The "Tidyverse" is a collection of R packages including the popular
   =ggplot2= visualization package, and =dplyr= for =data.frame=
   manipulation. I don't like it but don't let me stop you from liking
   and using the "Tidyverse" packages: You can turn it into an
   interesting project, too! Hadley Wickham is a central figure for
   the "Tidyverse". He is also the author of the free "R in Action"
   textbook, of the original =ggplot2=, and of RStudio.
   #+end_quote

** DONE A brief review of R - 10 problems

** DONE Home assignment: Scoping & Environments

Some students asked for a reminder. See also solution PDF in GitHub.

1. How would you put this code into an R script?
   #+begin_example R
   hist(Nile)
   #+end_example
   #+begin_src R :tangle histNile.R
     hist(Nile)  # tangle with C-c C-v t (org-babel-tangle)
   #+end_src

2. How would you check that a script exists without leaving R?
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     ls -l *.R  # on the CLI use the `ls` command
   #+end_src
   #+begin_src R :results output
     system("ls -l *.R*")   # shell() on Windoze
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 55 Feb  4 11:11 histNile.R
   : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 11 Feb  4 11:10 hN.R

3. How can you run the script on the command-line?
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     Rscript histNile.R
   #+end_src
   #+begin_src R :results output
     system("Rscript histNile.R")
     system("ls -l *R*")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus   55 Feb  4 11:11 histNile.R
   : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus   11 Feb  4 11:10 hN.R
   : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 4609 Feb  4 11:15 Rplots.pdf

4. What is the output of the script?
   #+begin_src R :results output
     system("file R*") # Rscript produces R* files
     system("evince Rplots.pdf")  # evince is a Linux PDF viewer app
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Rplots.pdf: PDF document, version 1.4, 1 pages

   This is what we do when we use notebooks in class:
   #+begin_src R :file histNile.png :results output graphics file :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     hist(Nile)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:histNile.png]]

5. What is the other way to run R scripts on the command-line?
   #+begin_src R :results output
     system("R CMD BATCH histNile.R")
     system("ls -l *.R* R*")
     system("cat histNile.Rout")

** TODO Review & Practice: Arguments / Loops

1) Is ~matrix~ elliptic?
   #+begin_src R :results output

   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

2) Use positional matching with ~seq~ to create a sequence of values
   between -4 and 4 that progresses in steps of 0.2.
   #+begin_src R :results output

   #+end_src

3) Identify, which style of argument matching is being used:
   exact, partial, positional, or mixed. If mixed, which arguments are
   specified?

   1. ~array~
      #+begin_src R :results output
        array(8:1,dim=c(2,2,2))
      #+end_src

   2. ~rep~
      #+begin_src R :results output
        rep(1:2,3)
      #+end_src

   3. ~seq~
      #+begin_src R :results output
        seq(from=10,to=8,length=5)
      #+end_src

   4. ~sort~
      #+begin_src R :results output
        sort(decreasing=T,x=c(2,1,1,2,0.3,3,1.3))
      #+end_src

   5. ~which~ (1)
      #+begin_src R :results output
        matrix(c(T,F,T,T),2,2)
        which(matrix(c(T,F,T,T),2,2))
      #+end_src

   6. ~which~ (2)
      #+begin_src R :results output
        which(matrix(c(T,F,T,T),2,2),a=T)
        args(which)
      #+end_src

4) What is the key difference between a =for= loop and a =while= loop?
   #+begin_quote
   A =for= loop iterates over a predefined sequence, such as a vector
   or list, and executes the loop body once for each element.

   A =while= loop, on the other hand, continues executing as long as a
   specified condition remains =TRUE=, making it useful for situations
   where the number of iterations is not known in advance.
   #+end_quote

5) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a =for= loop
   instead of a =while= loop in R?

   #+begin_quote
   *Advantages:*
   - A =for= loop is generally more readable and requires fewer lines of
     code when iterating over a known sequence.
   - It reduces the risk of infinite loops since the iteration count
     is predetermined.
   - It is easier to debug because the loop boundaries are explicitly
     defined.

   *Disadvantages:*
   - A =for= loop is less flexible when the number of iterations is not
     known in advance.
   - If the sequence length changes dynamically within the loop, a =for=
     loop may not behave as expected.
   - It can be less efficient when iterating over large datasets
     compared to vectorized solutions.
   #+end_quote

6) Write a =for= and a =while= loop that prints the numbers 1 to 5.
   #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
     for (i in 1:5)
       print(i)

     i <- 1
     while(i<=5) {
       print(i)
       i <- i + 1
     }
   #+end_src

7) Modify the loops to print the numbers as part of a vector like so:
   #+begin_example
     [1] 1 2 3 4 5
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
     foo <- c()
     for (i in 1:5) {
       foo[i] <- i
     }
     foo

     bar <- c()
     i <- 1
     while(i<=5) {
       bar[i] <- i
       i <- i + 1
     }
     bar
   #+end_src

8) Write a =for= loop that prints each element of a vector, where the
   vector’s length is unknown in advance. Example vector:
   =c("Joe","Jim","Jane","Jack","Jill")=

   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
     values <- c("Joe","Jim","Jane","Jack","Jill")  # could be any length

     for (i in 1:length(values)) {
       print(values[i])
     }
   #+END_SRC

9) Write a =while= loop that processes a Boolean vector, stopping as
   soon as it encounters the first =FALSE= value, when the length of the
   vector is not known. Example vector: =c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE,
   TRUE, TRUE)=

   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
     flags <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)  # Boolean vector
     i <- 1  # Initialize index

     while (i <= length(flags) && flags[i]) { # TRUE if both are TRUE
       print(paste("Processing element", i))
       i <- i + 1  # Increment index
     }
   #+END_SRC

10) Consider the following R code, explain step by step what this loop
    does, and determine the output.
    #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
      vec <- c(5, 2, 9, 0, 3, 8, 7)
      i <- 1

      while (i <= length(vec)) {
        if (vec[i] == 0) {
          print("Zero encountered! Stopping loop.")
          break
        } else if (vec[i] %% 2 == 0) {
          i <- i + 1
          next
        }
        print(vec[i])
        i <- i + 1
      }
    #+END_SRC

    #+begin_quote
    *Step-by-step execution:*
    - The loop starts with =i = 1= and checks if =vec[i] == 0=.
    - If =vec[i]= is =0=, it prints ="Zero encountered! Stopping loop."= and
      exits (=break=).
    - If =vec[i]= is even, the =next= statement skips printing and moves to the next iteration.
    - Otherwise, it prints =vec[i]= and increments =i=.

    *Tracing the execution:*
    - =vec[1] = 5= → odd, so =print(5)=, increment =i= to 2.
    - =vec[2] = 2= → even, so =next= skips printing, increment =i= to 3.
    - =vec[3] = 9= → odd, so =print(9)=, increment =i= to 4.
    - =vec[4] = 0= → =break= triggers, prints ="Zero encountered! Stopping
      loop."= and exits.

* Week 5: Switch & Loops

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Do I have to review my didactic approach? My assumption has
been that if I force you to type everythng in while I do it, it will
somehow rub off on you, and motivate you to continue on your own
later. But now I am not so sure anymore. *Care to let me know what it
would take for you to get better at coding?* More graded exercises?
