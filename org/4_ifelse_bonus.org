- This assignment introduces conditional statements (if-else) in R, as
  well as ~%in%~, ~any~, ~substr~ and ~ifelse~.

- Complete and submit the Org-mode file to Canvas with your name,
  pledge, and clear explanations of your process.

- If you use generative AI, credit it, explain how you used it, and be
  ready to explain your solution in class.

- When you submit a solution you'll get my sample solution to check.

* Problem

Write R code that takes a vector of character strings and checks if
any string begins with the letter ~g~ (lowercase or uppercase).

- If at least one string starts with ~g~, replace those specific strings
  with ~"FOUND"~.
- If no strings start with ~g~, replace the entire vector with a new
  vector of the same length filled with ~"NONE"~.

/Tip:/ Use ~substr~ to check the first letter and ~ifelse~ for conditional
replacement.

* Solution

Develop your solution step-by-step:

1) Create a vector of strings to test.
2) Use ~substr~ to extract the first letter of each string and store the
   result in an object =first_letters=.
3) Print the =first_letters= object.
4) Use an ~if~-~else~ statement with ~%in%~ to check for 'g' or 'G'.
5) To replace strings starting with 'g' or 'G', use ~ifelse~.
6) To replace the whole vector, use ~rep~ over the ~length~ of the vector.

Hereâ€™s starter pseudocode in R comments to guide you:
#+begin_src R
  ## Define a vector `my_vector` of character strings

  ## Extract the first letter of each string in the vector

  ## Check if any first letter is 'g' or 'G'
  ## if (any first_letters is 'g' or 'G') then

  ##   Replace strings starting with 'g' or 'G' with "FOUND"

  ## else
  ##   Replace the whole vector with "NONE" repeated for its length

  ## end if

  ## Print the result
#+end_src

Write your R code below this block.

#+begin_src R

#+end_src

* Test your solution

Test your code with these vectors and check the output:

#+begin_src R
  vector1 <- c("cat", "dog", "fish")
  vector2 <- c("giraffe", "zebra", "Gorilla")
  vector3 <- c("apple", "banana", "cherrygrape")
#+end_src

Expected output:
#+begin_example
[1] "NONE" "NONE" "NONE"
[1] "FOUND" "zebra" "FOUND"
[1] "NONE" "NONE" "NONE"
#+end_example

* Bonus challenges

- Wrap your code in a function =check_g= that accepts a vector and
  returns the changed vector. Sample call: =check_g(my_vector)=.

- Wrap your code in a function =check_first_letter= that accepts a
  vector and a letter and returns the changed vector. Sample call:
  =check_first_letter(my_vector,my_letter).=
